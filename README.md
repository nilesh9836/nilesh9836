I’m Nilesh, I’m a frontend developer, and I specialize in efficient Vue apps and CSS & HTML that just work across all 
platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building interfaces that are usable and pleasant for the most number of people possible. 
My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for design and structure. I was sketching crazy detailed 3d models for fun when 
I was a kid, started building promo websites for small businesses while in college. For three years, I have been working for a product 
based company where we develop a lot of functionality in my product which is helpful for our clients. Right now, I’m excited about the still 
very complicated WebAssembly, and working towards becoming a Vue senior. In the following years, I also plan to explore the “server-side” more 
and become a better-rounded full-stack dev.
